## 1. What is The Forge Factory?

The Forge Factory is an operational system that transforms client ideas into deployed, production-grade software using the Forge methodology. It's designed for:

- **Predictable delivery** — Standard projects ship in known timeframes
- **Consistent quality** — Every project inherits enterprise-grade foundations
- **Profitable margins** — Reuse, automation, and AI amplify your capacity
- **Scalable operations** — Grow from solo to team without chaos

### The Factory Equation

```
Client Idea + Forge Factory = Deployed Product

Where:
- Input: Vague idea, napkin sketch, or detailed requirements
- Process: Standardized intake → discovery → build → deploy → operate
- Output: Production-grade SaaS with ongoing support
- Multiplier: AI automation at every stage
```

### Factory Principles

1. **Productize Everything** — Standard offerings with clear scope and pricing
2. **Automate the Predictable** — AI handles boilerplate, humans handle judgment
3. **Reuse Relentlessly** — Every project contributes to the component library
4. **Scope Tightly** — Fixed scope = fixed price = predictable profit
5. **Operate What You Build** — Maintenance revenue is recurring revenue

## 2. Business Model

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Description | Margin | Predictability | Target % |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|----------|

| **Custom Projects** | Bespoke builds with T&M or fixed-bid | 40-50% | Medium | 15% |
| **Retainers** | Ongoing development, priority support | 65-75% | Very High | 40% |
| **Managed Hosting** | Infrastructure + monitoring + updates | 70-80% | Very High | 10% |
| **Consulting** | Strategy, architecture, technical advisory | 80%+ | Low | 5% |

### Target Client Segments

| Segment | Profile | Typical Engagement | Price Range |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Startup** | Funded, needs MVP fast | MVP in 4-6 weeks | $20K - $50K |
| **SMB** | Established business, internal tools or customer apps | Full app in 8-12 weeks | $50K - $150K |
| **Mid-Market** | Growing company, complex requirements | Enterprise app in 12-20 weeks | $100K - $300K |
| **Enterprise** | Large org, compliance, integrations | Custom engagement | $200K+ |

### Unit Economics

```

### Estimation Framework

```yaml
# Slice-Based Estimation

slice_sizes:
  XS:  # < 4 hours
    description: "Simple UI change, config update"
    points: 1
    hours: 2-4
    
  S:   # 4-8 hours
    description: "Simple feature, basic CRUD"
    points: 2
    hours: 4-8
    
  M:   # 1-2 days
    description: "Standard feature with tests"
    points: 5
    hours: 8-16
    
  L:   # 2-4 days
    description: "Complex feature, multiple components"
    points: 8
    hours: 16-32
    
  XL:  # 4-8 days (should be split)
    description: "Epic - needs decomposition"
    points: 13
    hours: 32-64

estimation_process:
  1. List all features from PRD
  2. Break into vertical slices
  3. Size each slice (XS-XL)
  4. Apply complexity multiplier
  5. Add buffer for unknowns (15-25%)
  6. Convert to timeline
  
complexity_multipliers:
  standard: 1.0      # Known patterns, familiar tech
  moderate: 1.25     # Some new patterns, learning curve
  complex: 1.5       # Significant unknowns, new tech
  very_complex: 2.0  # R&D required, experimental

buffer_guidelines:
  new_client: 25%    # First project together
  repeat_client: 15% # Established relationship
  unclear_scope: 30% # Vague requirements
  tight_timeline: 20% # Compressed schedule

## 12. Pricing Framework

### Pricing Principles

1. **Value-based** — Price based on value to client, not just hours
2. **Transparent** — Clear scope, no hidden fees
3. **Predictable** — Fixed price for fixed scope
4. **Profitable** — Target 50%+ gross margin

### Pricing Formula

```
Price = (Base Hours × Hourly Rate × Complexity Multiplier) + Risk Buffer

Where:
- Base Hours: Estimated from slices
- Hourly Rate: $150-250 depending on client segment
- Complexity Multiplier: 1.0-1.5 based on technical complexity
- Risk Buffer: 10-20% for unknowns
```

### Rate Card

| Role | Internal Cost | Client Rate | Margin |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Senior Engineer (You + AI) | $75/hr | $200/hr | 63% |
| Mid Engineer | $50/hr | $150/hr | 67% |
| Designer | $50/hr | $150/hr | 67% |
| Project Manager | $40/hr | $125/hr | 68% |

### Package Pricing

| Package | Scope | Timeline | Price |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Discovery Only** | PRD + Spec + Estimate | 1 week | $5,000 |
| **MVP Sprint** | Core features, basic UI | 4 weeks | $25,000 |
| **Standard Build** | Full features, polished UI | 8 weeks | $60,000 |
| **Enterprise Build** | Full features + enterprise | 12 weeks | $120,000 |
| **Custom** | Based on scope | Varies | Quote |

### Pricing Psychology

- **Anchor high** — Show enterprise price first
- **Three options** — Basic, Standard, Premium (recommend middle)
- **Monthly vs Annual** — Annual gets 2 months free
- **Retainer discount** — 10% off build with retainer commitment
- **Referral credit** — $2,500 credit for successful referrals

### Discount Guidelines

```yaml
# When to Discount

never_discount:
  - First-time clients (sets bad precedent)
  - Scope is unclear
  - Client is price-shopping

consider_discount:
  - Strategic client (logo value)
  - Multi-project commitment
  - Long-term retainer signed
  - Referral from valued client
  - Case study permission

discount_limits:
  standard: 10% max
  strategic: 20% max
  requires_approval: >20%

alternative_to_discount:
  - Add more scope for same price
  - Extended payment terms
  - Free month of retainer
  - Priority scheduling
```

## Summary

**The Forge Factory** transforms client ideas into deployed software through:

1. **Standardized Intake** — Qualify leads quickly, filter bad fits
2. **Efficient Discovery** — AI-assisted PRD and spec generation
3. **Predictable Build** — Forge Method v4.1, vertical slices
4. **Smooth Launch** — Automated deployment, proper handoff
5. **Recurring Operations** — Retainers, managed hosting, ongoing value
